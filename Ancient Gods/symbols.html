              mythology. In addition to that, Ouroboros represented rebirth,
              recreation of life and perpetuity. In the Book of the Dead, the
              image of “the serpent eating itself or the serpent eating its
              tail” is closely associated with Atum, the first god to be born
              from the chaotic waters of the Nun (the primordial water from
              which all creation began in the first place) who was born from
              these waters in the form of a serpent that was renewed every
              morning.<br />

              Phoenicians who eventually passed it on to Greek culture. The name
              ouroboros was given to the symbol by the Greeks.<br />

              very commonly used all over the world, including Nordic mythology,
              where it is known as Jörmungandr.

              Tiet or Tyet, also known as the Knot of Isis and the Blood of
              Isis, is an Egyptian symbol that closely resembles the ankh
              symbol. Its meaning was also interpreted as similar to the ankh.
              It’s supposed to symbolize life. It was identified with the
              goddess Isis and used mostly with the ankh and the Djed pillar of
              Osiris because together they were interpreted as the dual nature
              of life. There is no precise information as to why it is called
              the Blood of Isis but it is supposed to be given because it
              represented the menstrual blood of Isis and the magical powers it
              gave.

            <h2>Feather Of Maat</h2>

            <p>
              Maat’s feather is one of the most common Egyptian symbols used in
              hieroglyphics. The goddess Maat represented justice in Egyptian
              culture and the Ma’at feather can be seen in the context of
              “ensuring justice” in ancient inscriptions. This is because the
              ancient Egyptians believed that one’s heart would be weighed
              against the Maat Feather in the Hall of Two Truths when one’s soul
              entered Duat. If his heart was found equal or lighter than this it
              would mean that he was a virtuous person and he would go to Aaru
              (paradise ruled by Osiris). If not, then his heart would be eaten
              by Ammit, the goddess who ate the soul and he would be cursed to
              remain in the Underworld forever.

              life among the Egyptians, especially the palm and the sycamore
              tree, where the latter was of greater importance because two
              specimens were supposed to grow at the gates of heaven, where Ra
              was daily. The Tree of Life was located in the Temple of the Sun
              of Ra in Heliopolis. The sacred tree of life first appeared when
              Ra, the sun god, first appeared at Heliopolis.

              the realm of the dead and that they descended there every night to

              Thus embodying the idea of sunrise and sunset. The circle in the
              center represents the Sun and the shapes found at the base would
              be the symbol of the Djew or mountains. In ancient Egypt, it is
              the place where the sun rises and sets; it is often translated as
              “horizon” or “mountain of light”. It is usually found the symbol
              of Ajet, guarded by the god Aker, the god of the underworld,
              composed of two lions that turned their backs on him, these lions
              represented the yesterday and today, and the eastern and western

            <h2>Obelisk</h2>

            <p>
              The obelisk is, together with the pyramids, one of the most famous
              Egyptian symbol of ancient Egypt. The obelisk is an architectural
              element that takes on a slender, truncated pyramid shape,
              surmounted by a pyramid-shaped tip. Usually the obelisks were made
              from a single block of stone. in ancient Egypt obelisks were
              erected at the will of Pharaoh with the intention of invoking the
              protection of the Sun God Ra. Usually the obelisks were placed at
              the entrance of the temples, as they were not only the symbol to
              celebrate the divinity, but they were also accommodation for the
              god himself, who was believed to be present inside. Obelisk has a
              fundamental symbolic importance that is connected to the “energies
              of the earth”, expression of the active and fecundating principle
              that penetrates and radiates the passive and fecundated element.
              As a solar symbol, the obelisk has a strong masculine
              characterization, and in fact it is no coincidence that its high
              and imperious shape obviously recalls the phallic element. The
              alternation of the sun and the seasons caused the overflowing of
              the Nile River in ancient Egypt, which left a highly fertilizing
              silt on the arid sand, dark in colour, which made the land fertile
              and cultivable, thus ensuring the life and survival of the
              community. This black land, which in ancient Egypt was called
              kemet, gave its name to the hermetic discipline of Alchemy, which
              symbolically resumes its principle. The obelisks also represented
              a symbol of power, as they had to remind the subjects of the
              existence of a link between the pharaoh and the divinity.

            <p>
              The perfection of the shen ring, devoid of beginning and end, made
              this amulet a symbol of eternity, its round shape associated it to
              the disk of the Sun: in the paintings it often appeared supported
              by animals or birds, like the hawk, with strong heliac
              connotations. The magic rings were very revered, attributing them
              the power to protect against diseases, as each circle represents
              the protection of one’s ego from external influences, that’s why
              the magician locked himself inside a magic circle surrounded by
              symbols and names of “power” that were nothing but physical forms
              of parts of the unconscious of the magician who would have to
              fight against himself to obtain the release of energies that would
              take shape and character depending on the type of ritual that was
              performed. Rituals always need external protection at least until
              the magician learns to build his circle in his aura, at which
              point he will no longer need particular objects to protect himself
              from external aggression or pseudo-attacks. The Shen ring is
              represented as a knotted and braided rope in a circular form. Its
              meanings are extremely complex but perhaps the most common is the
              one that represents it as a ring of power.
